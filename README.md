# Software Requirement Specification
>By: Emma Escandon

>Template Used for section 1: https://asana.com/resources/software-requirement-document-template

>Template Used for sections 2 and onwards: https://github.com/rick4470/IEEE-SRS-Tempate#21-product-perspective

## 1. **Introduction**
>The purpose of this document is to specify the Software Requirements of the Classparency protoype. This document will also lay out an overview of the system processes that will allow the SDD to specify more throughly. 

### 1.1  **Product Scope**
>The goal of this system is to create a more equitable classroom by identifying student needs. By providing classroom statistics, Classparency can lead to fewer misunderstandings between teachers and students and help teachers identify students who need more resources. By allowing parents to request their students data, Classparency also keeps parents involved in student success.

### 1.2 **Product Value**
>The intended audience will find value in the product because it will relieve the stress that teachers deal with regarding classroom management and curriculum. It will also help parents can hold their students accountable and be more notified and on track with the classroom. Classparency is also a better solution to find the root cause of any problem in the classroom and make data driven decisions.

### 1.3  **Intended Audience**
>This document will serve as a guide for Clients and Developers in understanding what this prototype offers to users. The main audience of Classparency are K-12 teachers and parents. It is a transparent bridge between parents and teachers, in order to benefit the student to the greatest extent and serve the students in their best interest for the long term.

### 1.4 **Intended Use**
>The intended use of Classparency is during class time for teachers. During class time, teachers would log student behavior, attendance, and grades. At any time, parents can use the form provided from the landing page to enter their student's ID number and access their student's information.

### 1.5 **General Description**
>Classparency is a web application prototype that provides dashboard, announcement, event, student information, attendance, behavior, and gradebook pages. Upon logging in the teacher is redirected to the dashboard page, where they can see the classroom statistics as a whole, events, and announcments. On the announcement page, the teacher can view, add, update, or delete announcements. On the event page, the teacher can view, add, update, or delete events. On the student page, the teacher can view, add, update, or delete students. On the behavior page, the teacher can add, update, or delete behavior incidents for a given student. On the attendance page, the teacher can add, update, or delete attendance for a given student. On the gradebook page, the teacher can add, update, or delete assignments for a given student. For a parent, they would be able to access a form from the landing page where they can request and view their students data by inputting their student ID. Student information includes: grades, attendance, behavior incidents, member of any specific group (i.e SPED, EL, internet access at home), student ID number, and gender. Within the class period is where student information and classroom statistics would be logged by the teacher.

## 2 **Overall Description**
### 2.1 **Product Perspective**
>Classparency is a replacement for teacher portal and is a web application for teachers to keep track of classroom data and inform parents. Here is a diagram of the prototype system as a whole:

### 2.2 **Product Functions**
>Since this product is currently a prototype, there is a single super user with prefilled class information.

>Teacher Functions:
- Login with username and password
- View Dashboard
- Add, Update, and Delete Announcements
- Add, Update, and Delete Events
- Add, Update, and Delete Students
- Add, Update, and Delete Student Attendance
- Add, Update, and Delete Student Behavior
- Add, Update, and Delete Student Assignments
>Parent:
- Access link on landing page
- Enter Student ID number to view that student's particular information

### 2.3 **User Classes and Characteristics**
>Client (Teacher) -  Main User
- Must be comfortable working with technology
- Access the their student information
- Teacher will have access to classroom statistics (academic, behavior, attendance)
- Able to perform the Teacher functions specified in section 2.2
> Parent - Secondary User
- Only able to access their student information with student ID
- Able to perform the Parent functions specified in section 2.2
> Admin - Developers
- Access to client credentials
- Access to student information, parent contact information, all data stored in database

### 2.4 **Operating Environment**
>Classparency is a web based responsive application, it will be running on any web browser. Currently, the web applicaton can only run on a device's local host. Therefore, the user must have the latest versions of MongoDB 6.0, Node JS 18.11, Pug JS 3.0.2, and Express JS 4.18.2 installed on their machine. In addition, the user must use their terminal to start up the server on their local host. The MongoDB cluster is not locally hosted which means it can be accessed from anywhere with the correct credentials. The web applications runs on localhost:3000 so that must go at the beginning of the URL. The machine must be connected to the interent in order for the web application to properly load. To run the web page the user must enter: localhost:3000/login.html. This is for them to access the landing page.

### 2.5 **Design and Implementation Constraints**
>MongoDB is used for the database for its No SQL design and it's ability to easily be connected to Node JS applications. The MongoDB cluster is not locally hosted which means it can be accessed from anywhere with the correct credentials. Node.js and Express.js are being used to handle requests and the backend framework. Pug JS and CSS are used for the front end design and displaying the data. 

### 2.6 **User Documentation**
>The SRS and SDD will act as a guide for the user to navigate the protoype web application. 

### 2.7 **Assumptions and Dependencies**
>Currently the prototype uses dummy data but the actual product would need to access student information which FERPA protects, so FERPA contraints could limit the grade and attendance logging capabilites of the product. An assumption that is made is that the user has access to internet and their machine has the latest versions of MongoDB, Node JS, Pug JS, and Express JS downloaded. Also, the user is capable of downloading the code from GitHub and run the server on their local host from their machine's terminal. 

## 3 **External Interface Requirements**
### 3.1 **User Interfaces**
>The link will take you to our wireframe that was made on Figma by Maria G. There you will see an overview of the user interface for both parents and teachers: https://www.figma.com/proto/1gC0JJpeMySEPR0bbnZmYz/Untitled?page-id=0%3A1&node-id=213%3A2&viewport=4027%2C2265%2C0.31&scaling=scale-down&starting-point-node-id=213%3A2

>There is a sidebar that has navigation features to the different tabs just by clicking. The tabs include: Dashboard, Students, Grades, Attendance, Events, Behavior, and Announcements.

> The uses cases of each page when adding, deleting, or updating will be further discussed in the system feature section as well as the SDD document. 

### 3.2 **Hardware Interfaces**
>The Web app should be able to run on all the web browsers for desktops and laptops that can run the server on their machine.
The web app will be responsive, in nature so that it can be viewed on different devices with their own respective views. The server is hosted on the machine's local host on port 3000. The Express JS software listens to requests from that port. Based on the requests, the MongoDB client is created and connected, performs the database operation, then is closed. The MongoDB cluster is not locally hosted which means it can be accessed from anywhere with the correct credentials.

### 3.3 **Software Interfaces**
>MongoDB 6.0, Node JS 18.11, and Express JS 4.18.2 are used for backend. Pug JS 3.0.2 and CSS are used for the frontend structure and design. 

- Node Download Link: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
- Express Download Link: https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html
- Pug Download Link: https://www.npmjs.com/package/pug
- MongoDB Download Link: https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/shell

### 3.4 **Communication Interfaces**
>The web application runs on the machine's local host. All requests sending data to the database use POST requests. When a page is loaded, getting data from the database, GET requests are used. 

## 4 **System Features**
>With this being a protoype, the features are based on a single super user. There is a sidebar that has navigation features to the different tabs just by clicking. The tabs include: Dashboard, Students, Grades, Attendance, Events, Behavior, and Announcements. To get the server running, make sure you are in the directory where you have downloaded the code. From there go into the directory "backend" and enter "node index.js". To access the web page the user must enter: localhost:3000/login.html. This is for them to access the landing page.

## 5 **Other Nonfunctional Requirements**
### 5.1 **Performance Requirements**
>The server should handle GET and POST responses quickly for the pages that show data. The updating and deleting of students, behavior, attendance, and grades actions will take a few minutes for the server to process of the requests and update the database. Adding an assignment, behavior incident, and attendance will also take a few minutes for the same reason. The dashbaord will take a few seconds to open since the statistics must be calculated and displayed.

### 5.2 **Safety Requirements**
>Access to unauthorized data through parent information retrieval form, could be a possibility to exploit the application. However, since the student ID number is unique and not widely acessible it is a safer method. 

### 5.3 **Security Requirements**
>FERPA requirements (Product would need to access student information which FERPA protects) should be taken into consideration, since the information of minors are involved. However, since this is a prototype dummy data is currently in use. Authentication login process would be enforced in order to protect data and potential break vulnerability in the system.Parents must provide their child’s student ID  in order to gain access to their records

### 5.4 **Software Quality Attributes**
- Reliability: Student information is secure and the web application crashes will be limited so users are not without this resource during class time .
- Correctness: Data analysis is correctly implemented so as not to display incorrect information.
- Usability: Should be easy to use so as to limit the stress on users and can be used during class time. This is why drop down option lists are provided for the addition and deletion of data. 
- Portability: The web application can be accessed from a computer and laptopn. 
- Interoperabilitye: Several different subsystems will neeed to communication with eachother in a precise manner. The webpage, server backend, and database all communicate with eachother and rely on eachother. 

### 5.5 **Business Rules**
- Client (Teacher) - Potential admin of the system, and the main user of the web app.
- Parents: They can only request information about theory child through a request form.
- Admin - Developers: Able to access to client credentials, student information, and parent contact information

## 6 **Other Requirements**
>There must be an instance of MongoDB 6.0 for the information entry and retrieval. To run the web page the user must enter: localhost:3000/login.html. This is for them to access the landing page.
### **Appendix A: Glossary**
- SPED: Special Education 
- EL: English Learning
- ID: Identification
- Dummy Data: Data that was made up for mock purposes

## 3 **System Architecture**
>To implement our web application we used a modified version of the MERN stack. MongoDB 6.0, Node JS 18.11, and Express JS 4.18.2 are used for backend. Pug JS 3.0.2 and CSS are used for the frontend structure and design. To handle the front-end we chose to use Pug JS so the HTML page (designed with CSS) can display the data from the database. Express JS is used to set up the server connection and to get requests and send responses. MongoDB is used as the database to store the classroom data. Node JS is used to make the classes and to implement the entire system. The server is hosted on the machine's local host on port 3000. The Express JS software listens to requests from that port. Based on the requests, the MongoDB client is created and connected, performs the database operation, then is closed. The MongoDB cluster is not locally hosted which means it can be accessed from anywhere with the correct credentials.

### 6.2 **External Interface Data**
>The data is in use in the Node JS implementation and is stored in MongoDB.

### 6.3 **Transformation of Data**
>When an item is added to the database the information is taken from the user, turned into an object, turned in the JSON representation, then added to the database where it is then considered a document. When an item is retrieved from the database

## 7 **User Interface Design**
### 7.1 **User Interface Design Overview**
>The link will take you to our wireframe that was made on Figma by Maria G. There you will see an overview of the user interface for both parents and teachers: https://www.figma.com/proto/1gC0JJpeMySEPR0bbnZmYz/Untitled?page-id=0%3A1&node-id=213%3A2&viewport=4027%2C2265%2C0.31&scaling=scale-down&starting-point-node-id=213%3A2

### 7.2 **User Interface Navigation Flow**

### 7.3 **Use Cases / User Function Description**
> Refer to [Section 4](#4-system-features) System Features of the SRS for the description of each user function

## 8 **Other Interfaces**
> The Web app should be able to run on all the web browsers for desktops and laptops that can run the server on their machine. The web app will be responsive, in nature so that it can be viewed on different devices with their own respective views. The server is hosted on the machine's local host on port 3000. The Express JS software listens to requests from that port. Based on the requests, the MongoDB client is created and connected, performs the database operation, then is closed. MongoDB 6.0, Node JS 18.11, and Express JS 4.18.2 are used for backend. Pug JS 3.0.2 and CSS are used for the frontend structure and design. The web application runs on the machine's local host. All requests sending data to the database use POST requests. When a page is loaded, getting data from the database, GET requests are used. 

## 9 **Extra Design Features / Outstanding Issues**
>To get the server running, make sure you are in the directory where you have downloaded the code. From there go into the directory "backend" and enter "node index.js". To access the web page the user must enter: localhost:3000/login.html. This is for them to access the landing page.

> The updating and deleting of students, behavior, attendance, and grades actions will take a few minutes for the server to process of the requests and update the database. Adding an assignment, behavior incident, and attendance will also take a few minutes for the same reason. The dashbaord will take a few seconds to open since the statistics must be calculated and displayed. To make this faster in the next iteration, we would use MongoDB aggregations to calculate data instead of JavaScript functions. Due to the nature of a protoype, there is no error handling when adding, upating, or deleting objects.
